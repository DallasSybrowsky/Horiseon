## User Story

AS A marketing agency

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements

2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

3. WHEN I view the icon and image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes

4. WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order

5. WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Homework
I updated the numerous <div> elements throughout the code, and updated them to follow semantic HTML guidelines. I ensured that the acceibility of the page was up to standard by including alts for the images and logos so that they're able to be used more efficiently by users utilizing screen readers.
